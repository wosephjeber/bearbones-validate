form-validator
==============

An object-oriented Javascript form validator. Still in the works.

##FAQs

**Q:** Why am I building a Javascript form validator when so many already exist?

**A:** I wanted the challenge, and the other validation scripts I have seen are pretty large and do more than I need them to. I wanted to create a lightweight library to do exactly what I needed it to do.
